# 🏠 Home Price Visualization – Exploring Linear Relationships(Day 1)

This mini project is part of my Machine Learning learning journey.

## 📈 Project Summary
I used a small dataset of house areas and their prices to explore the relationship between the two variables.

### 🔍 Observation
There is a clear linear trend — as area increases, so does the price — suggesting that a linear regression model might fit well.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib

## 📁 Next Steps
- Apply linear regression to fit a model
- Evaluate model accuracy
- Make predictions
